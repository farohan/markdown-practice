# __An Overview of JavaScript__

![JavaScript's Logo - Yellow background with Grey Letters Saying "JS"](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/sdz-upload/prod/upload/js2.jpg "JavaScript's Logo") 

*JavaScript* is a fast, front-end, and mostly in-browser programming language. It is my ~~least~~ favorite language as of right now because of all the cool tricks it has to offer. You can do most anything with the language, anything from math to scanning and manipulating HTML documents to even seeing your geolocation statistics!

Here are some other things you can do with JavaScript:

* Device Vibration - Make a phone vibrate in response to a new text message, for example.
* Copy to Clipboard - Allow a user to copy stuff onto their clipboard.
* Screen Wake Lock - Stop a device's screen from dimming, usually used for loading things.

JavaScript, like many other languages, has old and new versions. Here are the versions of ECMAScript and their times:

1. ES1 (1997)
1. ES2 (1998)
1. ES3 (1999)
1. ES5 (2009)
1. ES6 (2015)

__Note:__ ECMAScript 4 was never released, and there were more versions made after ES6, but ES6 is the most commonly used as of 2021.

## __JS Code Example__

```js
    let x = 100;
    let y = 20;
    let z = x / y;
    console.log(z);
```
In the example above, I am creating two variables, x and y. X is equal to 100, and y is equal to 20. Then, I am dividing x by y using another variable called z. Finally, I log z in the console.
